  Background:
    Given the device with information
      | mac_address      | 099789665701               |
      | serial_number    | A123456                    |
      | model_name       | NAS540                     |
      | firmware_version | 1.0                        |
      | algo             | 1                          |
      | ip_address       | 173.194.112.35             |

  Scenario Outline: [REST_00_02_01]
    Check incorrect update process when invalid format
    Given the device is not registered
      And the device "<information>" was be changed to "<value>"
     When the device send "register" request to REST API /d/3/register
     Then the API should return "<http_status>" and "<json_message>" with "failure" responds
      And the database does not have record
    Examples: Invalid mac_address format
      | information | value             | http_status | json_message      |
      | mac_address | @@@@@@@@@         | 400         | invalid parameter |
      | mac_address | 6D-81-45-4B-1A-B8 | 400         | invalid parameter |
      | mac_address | A6:3A:B9:05:3E:B3 | 400         | invalid parameter |

  Scenario: [REST_00_02_02]
    Check incorrect update process when signature invalid
    Given the device is not registered
      And the device "signature" was be changed to "abcde"

     Then the API should return "400" and "Invalid signature" with "error" responds
      And the database does not have record

  Scenario: [REST_00_02_03]

      And the device's IP is "173.194.112.35"
     When the device send "register" request to REST API /d/3/register
     Then the API should return success respond
      And the record in databases as expected

    Check correct update process when valid format and IP changed
     Given the device is registered
      And the device has a DDNS record, and ip is "9.9.9.9"
      And the device "<information>" was be changed to "<value>"
      And the device send "register" request to REST API /d/3/register

      | firmware_version | 2.0               |
      | ip_address       | 173.194.112.100   |

  Scenario: [REST_00_02_05]
